## Version History

* v2.1 release
    * Consolidated all the individual modules for each game into one module.
    * Added type annotations to all the functions and variables.
    * Added a gitignore file.
    * Fixed typos.
* Pre-v2.1 release
    * Completed the redesign of the website, and uploaded it to Google Cloud for deployment.
    * Completed the desktop version CSS for the entire site. Also, the app works properly now. However, it will not
      resize properly for mobile devices because I haven't completed the CSS for those devices yet.
    * I'm currently creating "Build v2" of the app to improve the layout and design. Plus, I added another lottery game.
      The changes aren't live on the website yet.
